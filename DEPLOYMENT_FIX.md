# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## 🚨 **Issue**: Website Showing README Instead of React App

### **Problem Description:**
The website at https://coltigent.github.io was showing the README.md content instead of the React application.

### **Root Cause:**
GitHub Pages wasn't properly configured to serve the built React application from the correct source.

## ✅ **Solutions Applied:**

### **1. Manual Deployment (Immediate Fix)**
```bash
# Build the React app
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Site should now be working

### **2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**
Reverted to the more reliable `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages (gh-pages)
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./build
    cname: coltigent.github.io
```

## 🔧 **Required GitHub Repository Configuration:**

### **Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Source**
1. Go to: https://github.com/coltigent/coltigent.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Choose **gh-pages** branch
4. Click **Save**

### **Step 2: Verify Repository Settings**
1. **Actions Permissions**: Settings → Actions → General
   - ✅ **Read and write permissions**
   - ✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

2. **Pages Settings**: Settings → Pages
   - ✅ **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - ✅ **Branch**: gh-pages
   - ✅ **Folder**: / (root)

## 📊 **Current Status:**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- ✅ Manual deployment completed successfully
- ✅ React app built and deployed to gh-pages branch
- ✅ CNAME file created for custom domain
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow updated

### 🔄 **What Should Happen Next:**
- The website should now show the React application instead of README
- Future pushes to main branch will trigger automatic deployment
- GitHub Actions will build and deploy automatically

## 🌐 **Test Your Website:**

### **Check These URLs:**
- **Main Site**: https://coltigent.github.io
- **Home Page**: https://coltigent.github.io/
- **About Page**: https://coltigent.github.io/about
- **Contact Page**: https://coltigent.github.io/contact
- **Services**: https://coltigent.github.io/services/web-development

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Professional Coltigent website with navigation
- ✅ Responsive design on all devices
- ✅ Working contact forms
- ✅ Service pages with detailed information
- ✅ Modern animations and styling

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Site Still Shows README:**
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check gh-pages Branch**: Verify it contains the built files
3. **Wait for DNS**: Sometimes takes 5-10 minutes to propagate
4. **Check GitHub Actions**: Ensure deployment completed successfully

### **If GitHub Actions Fails:**
1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure repository has proper permissions
2. **Verify Secrets**: GITHUB_TOKEN should be available
3. **Check Branch Protection**: Ensure gh-pages branch isn't protected

## 📋 **Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Website loads React app (not README)
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] All pages are accessible
- [ ] Contact forms are functional
- [ ] Responsive design works
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Animations work smoothly

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the website** thoroughly
2. **Verify all functionality** works as expected
3. **Share with your team** for feedback
4. **Monitor GitHub Actions** for future deployments
5. **Set up monitoring** for website performance

## 📞 **Support:**

If issues persist:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. Verify repository settings are correct
3. Ensure gh-pages branch contains built files
4. Contact GitHub support if needed
